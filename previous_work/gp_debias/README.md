### Our experiment settings
- python==3.7.2
- gensim==3.7.1
- numpy==1.16.2
- pandas==0.24.2
- torch==1.1.0


### How to train yourself

First download the [necessary data](https://github.com/uclanlp/gn_glove) listed below using following command.
- Trained glove and gn-glove
- SemBias dataset
- Female and male word lists
```
./download.sh
```
Perform debiasing for word embeddings and its evaluation. Debiased word embeddings are stored in `debiased_embeddings` in both bin and txt format. Name of word embeddings to be debiased as `glove` or `gn` and give as the first argument. For example,
```
./run.sh gn
```
You can also evaluate your word embaddings without training on SemBias:
```
python eval_word_embeddings.py -i path/to/your/embeddings
```
